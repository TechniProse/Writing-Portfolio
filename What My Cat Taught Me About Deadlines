I used to think I had a decent grip on time management. Then I got a cat.

At first, Elsa just lounged on my keyboard and stared at me like I was the one interrupting her workday. But over time, I realized something strange: this little ball of fur was a master at getting things done — or at least making sure I got things done. Here’s what my cat unknowingly taught me about sticking to deadlines:

1. Start your day with purpose
Elsa wakes me up every morning at 5:30 AM sharp. Not for yoga or meditation—for breakfast. But still, her consistency is inspiring. I’ve started waking up earlier, and my productivity has followed.

2. Take guilt-free breaks
Ever seen a cat take a 3-hour nap without an ounce of regret? That’s the energy. Breaks are not a luxury—they're necessary. A 15-minute pause can recharge your brain more than you think.

3. Eliminate distractions
Elsa will knock my pen off the table if she thinks I’m not paying attention. Dramatic? Maybe. But it’s a good reminder to put my phone away and focus.

4. Defend your space
If you’ve ever tried to sit in a cat’s favorite spot, you know it’s a crime. She guards her territory like it’s sacred. As a freelancer, I’m learning to protect my work time the same way—boundaries are everything.

5. Celebrate small wins
Finished a blog post? Reward yourself with a stretch, a snack, or a proud tail flick (metaphorically). If Luna gets excited over catching a shoelace, I can definitely be excited about hitting a deadline.
