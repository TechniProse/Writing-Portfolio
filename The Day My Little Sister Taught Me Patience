I used to think patience was a virtue I could master by reading a book or practicing deep breathing. That was before I helped my little sister with her homework.

She’s twelve years younger than me and has this magical way of asking the simplest questions that somehow require the deepest answers. “Why do birds fly but we can’t?” “Why does math have to be so complicated?” “Why do you always check your phone when I’m talking?”

Oof.

That last one hit differently. I paused, guilty, realizing she wasn’t just asking about her maths homework. She wanted attention. Real, undivided attention.

So I put the phone down. We did the math together — slowly. I explained the "long division method", and when she finally got it right, she beamed. Not because of the answer, but because I stayed with her through it.

In that moment, I learned something bigger than maths: Patience is love in action. It’s putting someone else first, even when it’s inconvenient. Even when your phone is buzzing. Even when you think you’re too busy.

Now, whenever I’m rushing through life, I try to remember her smile — and the quiet lesson she gave me that day.
